# **Welcome to the repository for the Lightbearer Slay the Spire mod!**
## Introduction
TheLightbearer mod is a small collaborative effort of two friends and our first attempt at modding. We are currently in Beta v1.0.1 and looking for feedback!
Please feel free to give it a try, find it on steam here --->(https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=3054190297)

## Goals
This mod started as a question, There has to be a Destiny X Slay The Spire mod right?, Suprisingly there wasnt. Being huge fans of both games we set off to fix that.
This mod starts with the Hunter Class and features only a couple new Mechanics, Mainly the charge of light and Super System. 

## Usage 
The Easiset way to get a usable copy of our mod is off the Steam workshop as listed above.

## Known Bugs 
Character coloring is bluetinted 

duplication effects not handled by necronomicon and duplication power, might not work with supers ie(omniscience or other modded dupe effects)

lots of card art still needs to be added(Suggestions welcome)
